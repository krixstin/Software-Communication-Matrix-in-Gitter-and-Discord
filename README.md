# Software Communication Matrix in Gitter and Discord
### Abstract
Software development communities utilize communication platforms to communicate with other developers to debug their code and get other developers' views on their issues. This project looks to analyze how engaging different communication platforms are for these software development communities. Specifically, this report aims to look at how engaging Gitter and Discord are for their users in a software development community. The community that will be examined is the Angular community, a software development community centered around developers working with Angular projects. This report starts by giving a brief history and background between the two communication platforms. Additionally, this report will show metrics extracted from chat logs from both Gitter and Discord to help measure how engaging the platforms are. From the metrics, one will be able to see how the Angular community is engaged on the Gitter and Discord platforms. When one looks at the metrics, both platforms are very similar in their engagement per user even though Gitter has a bigger community.
